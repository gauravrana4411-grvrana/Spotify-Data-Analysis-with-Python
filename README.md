# 🎧 Spotify Data Analysis with Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Spotify music data using Python to uncover insights about song popularity, artist performance, genre trends, and listener preferences.  
By performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations, the project converts raw music data into actionable insights that can support decision-making in the music and streaming industry.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand what types of songs are most popular
- Identify top artists and genres on Spotify
- Analyze how audio features (danceability, energy, tempo, acousticness) impact song popularity
- Study how music trends change over time
- Provide data-driven insights for streaming platforms, artists, and marketers

## 📂 Dataset Description
The project uses two datasets:

### 1️⃣ Tracks Dataset
Contains song-level audio features such as:
- Popularity
- Danceability
- Energy
- Tempo
- Loudness
- Acousticness
- Release Year

### 2️⃣ Artists Dataset
Contains artist-related information including:
- Artist name
- Popularity
- Genre details

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
The following steps were performed to ensure data quality:
- Loaded CSV files using Pandas
- Checked data structure, size, and data types
- Handled missing values by removing records with critical missing attributes
- Removed duplicate records
- Corrected data types for numerical analysis
- Ensured consistency and accuracy before analysis

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to understand patterns and relationships in the data:
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Correlation analysis between audio features
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Outlier detection in features like tempo and loudness

---

## 📊 Visualizations
The following visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn:
- Bar charts for top artists and genres by popularity
- Line charts to analyze music trends over time
- Scatter plots to study the impact of audio features on popularity
- Heatmaps to visualize correlations between multiple song attributes

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Songs with higher energy and danceability tend to be more popular
- Music preferences have shifted toward upbeat and energetic tracks
- Acoustic and slow-tempo songs cater to niche audiences
- Certain genres consistently dominate streaming platforms

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Streaming platforms can create mood-based playlists using tempo and energy
- Artists can optimize song features based on popular trends
- Marketing teams can target audiences using genre-based segmentation
- Early promotion of emerging genres can increase engagement
